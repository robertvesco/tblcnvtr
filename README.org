* Why? 

I often find myself with small tabular style data that I need to convert from one format to another. 

For example, 
- [ ] Copy a region from excel and paste it into an org mode tbl
- [ ] Convert one delimited type to another (tab -> csv -> pipe)
- [ ] Convert a column of data from a shell command (like git status) to a row that can be used in another
- [ ] create literal lists, vectors, matrics in python and R for creating test data and examples
